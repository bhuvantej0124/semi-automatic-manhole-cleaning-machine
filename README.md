# Semi-Automatic Manhole Cleaning Machine

## Overview
The Semi-Automatic Manhole Cleaning Machine is a safety-focused engineering solution
developed to eliminate hazardous manual manhole cleaning practices. The system enables
remote removal of sludge and debris from manholes without human entry, ensuring improved
safety, dignity, and efficiency for sanitation workers.

This project was developed as part of the **SAMVED Hackathon 2026** under the theme
**Safety & Assistance for Sanitation Workers**.

---

## Problem Statement
Manual manhole cleaning exposes sanitation workers to toxic gases, infections, and life-
threatening working conditions. Despite regulations banning manual scavenging, unsafe
cleaning practices still exist due to lack of affordable and practical mechanized solutions.

---

## Proposed Solution
The proposed Semi-Automatic Manhole Cleaning Machine is a portable system consisting of:
- A stable tripod structure
- Pulley and cable lifting mechanism
- Hand-crank or electric winch
- Clamshell grabber for waste extraction
- Gas detector for enhanced safety

The system allows sanitation workers to remove waste remotely from manholes, ensuring
**zero-entry operation** and minimizing health risks.

## Innovation and Uniqueness
- Zero-entry manhole cleaning mechanism
- Portable and lightweight design
- Mechanical lift optimization for safe load handling
- Precision cleaning suitable for confined urban spaces
- Integration of gas detection for worker safety
- Bridges the gap between manual labor and heavy machinery
